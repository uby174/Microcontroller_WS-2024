 Polling-Based Implementation:

Polling based system work by continously checking the state of the button inside the loop.

If button is Pressed than it set button_pressed = True
Is simple to implement but can less responsive if loop is high runtime.



Interrupt-Based Implementation:

A trigger is generated as soon as the button is pressed and system quickly responds to the interupt dur to it's high priority.

attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), buttonPressedISR, RISING); // attaching the interupt make our system more responsive but has a complex implementation
